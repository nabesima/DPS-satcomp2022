DPS is a new framework for easily constructing efficient deterministic
parallel SAT solvers, providing the delayed clause exchange technique
introduced in ManyGLucose. DPS-Kissat applies our framework to Kissat,
a state-of-the-art sequential SAT solver.

* How to build a docker container for AWS environment

: % cd leader
: % docker build -t dps:leader .

# DPS is a parallel SAT solver for shared memory environments. Thus we
# do not require a worker container. Given a problem, the container
# starts 32 threads that each run Kissat and solve the problem as a
# portfolio solver.  DPS-Kissat adopts the following simple diversity strategy
# 1. random variable selection up to the first contradiction
# 2. disabled elimination in half of the workers.
